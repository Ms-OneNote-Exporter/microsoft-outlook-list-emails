# NOTICE

## License

This project is released under the **MIT License**. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for
the full text.

## Commercial use

The MIT License grants anyone the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,
distribute, sublicense and sell copies of this software, including for
commercial purposes. **No permission is required, and none is withheld.**

This NOTICE cannot add conditions to the MIT License, and does not attempt to.
If you are reading this hoping it sets rules, it does not: the terms in
[LICENSE](LICENSE) are the terms.

**A courtesy request, not a restriction:** if you use this commercially, or build
on it in a way you make money from, please **let the author know** — an issue or
a note is welcome. This is a request out of interest in the project, not a
condition of use. Nobody can enforce it, and no licence condition depends on it.

## Attribution

The copyright notice and the MIT permission notice must be retained in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software. Keeping the author's name in the
files is the one real obligation MIT does impose, and the reason the author
field is populated in `package.json` for every package in this organisation.

## Paid features

If a paid or hosted version of this tool ever appears, it will be paid for as a
**service** — hosting, support, or convenience — never as a licence condition.
The code in this repository stays MIT for everyone, permanently. A licence
cannot be both permissively open and conditional, so the open-source grant is
not something that will ever be withdrawn or moved behind a paywall.

## Origin

Extracted from [MSOneNote Exporter](https://github.com/enoola/Microsoft-OneNote-Exporter).
Sibling packages: [microsoft-webauth](https://github.com/Ms-OneNote-Exporter/microsoft-webauth),
[microsoft-onenote-list-notebooks](https://github.com/Ms-OneNote-Exporter/microsoft-onenote-list-notebooks),
[microsoft-onenote-export-notebook](https://github.com/Ms-OneNote-Exporter/microsoft-onenote-export-notebook).

## Why this project exists

Authentication and mailbox listing is handled without the Graph API, using
Playwright with session state produced by
[microsoft-webauth](https://github.com/Ms-OneNote-Exporter/microsoft-webauth).
Same aim as the OneNote tools in this organisation: get your own data out of a
Microsoft product without needing Entra admin rights.
